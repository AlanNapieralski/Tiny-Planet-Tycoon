## Dependencies Installation

Before running the game, you need to install Python and the required Python libraries. To simplify this process, we‚Äôve included installation scripts for each platform.

### Windows Users üìù

1. **Open Terminal or Command Prompt** in the game folder.
2. **Run the installation script**:
```cmd
windows_install.bat
```
- This script will automatically:
  - Install Python (if not already installed)
  - Create a virtual environment
  - Install Pygame, NumPy, and PyInstaller
  - Build the `.exe` executable in the `dist` folder
3. Press any key when the installation completes.

### macOS Users üçé

1. **Open Terminal** in the game folder.
2. **Make the script executable** (first time only):
```bash
chmod +x macos_install.sh
```
3. **Run the installation script**:
```bash
./macos_install.sh
```
4. Ensure the resulting executable has execute permissions:
```bash
chmod +x dist/main
```

### Manual Installation (All Platforms)

```bash
# Windows
pip install pygame numpy pyinstaller

# macOS
pip3 install pygame numpy pyinstaller
```
